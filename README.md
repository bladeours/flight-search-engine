## General Info
I've created this project to learn Spring MVC and Thymeleaf. Unfortunately no company provides for free
REST API with flight data, so I had to create [flight generator](https://github.com/bladeours/random-flights-generator) then built
[REST API](https://github.com/bladeours/flight-api) to get mocked flight data. 

## Technologies Used
* Java 17
* Spring 2.7.3
* Thymeleaf
* Maven
