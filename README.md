## General Info
I've created this project to learn Spring MVC and Thymeleaf. Unfortunately no company provides for free
REST API with flight data, so I had to create [flight generator](https://github.com/bladeours/random-flights-generator) then built
[REST API](https://github.com/bladeours/flight-api) to get mocked flight data. You can create account,
change password, remove account or add flight to cart. Frontend is responsive so you can check this project 
on your phone.

## Technologies Used
* Java 17
* Spring 2.7.3
  * Spring Boot 
  * Spring Security
  * Spring Web
* Thymeleaf
* Bootstrap
* Junit 5
* Hibernate
* PostgreSQL
